All these features are needed in any application but due to the high level of complexity, developers only improvise them or even omit some of them.

- The fastest content delivery – 10,000 req/s
- The fastest search – 4x faster than IBM Enterprise Search
- Faster development – up to 80% of the application is already done
- Better applications: performance, security, stability
- Clear separation of content and code
- Reduce hardware costs by using DocumentHub “as a service”
