## Access control

Access control at the document level can be defined like this:

```
{
  "document": {
  },
  ...
  "access": {
    "owners": [
      "library1": ["john@doe.com"]
    ],
    "viewers": [
      "library1": ["all"]
    ]
  }
```

The access field is visible only for document owners.
If the access field is missing then the same read/write access from the catalog is applied also for the document.
