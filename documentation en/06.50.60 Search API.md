### Search API

#### Search Initialization

Search initialization json can be defined in catalog.json or can be set with patch catalog API. Search initialization is saved in the catalog so you don't have to call it again unless you want to change it.

Example of search initialization in catalog.json:

```
catalog.json
{
  ...
  "search": {
    "fields": [
      "document.title",
      "document.tags"
    ],
    "filters": [
      "document.category"
      "document.country.name Country"
    ]
  }
}
```
In this catalog, the search will run on the document.title and document.tags fields and the filters count and labels will be returned for document.category and document.country.name.
The filter labels are optional and can be defined in the same string as the filter key, separated by space.


This is an example of how the filters are defined and how they are shown in the application:

#### Search History

Returns the list of all searches ran on this catalog.


#### Simple Search

Search text in the metadata fields defined in search initialization. Returns the matching documents in the relevance order.


#### Advanced Search

Search, filter, sort, pagination and filters count in a single API request. 

All fields are optional.

```
{
  "search": "ibm",
  "filter": {
    "or": {},
    "and": {
      "document.language": "en",
      "document.type": [
        "course",
        "article"
      ],
      "document.cost": {
        "gt": 0,
        "lte": 1000
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": {},
  "limit": {
    "from": 0,
    "to": 99
  },
  "fuzzy": false,
  "returnFilterValues": false,
  "returnFiltersCount": false,
  "returnFilterCounters": false,
  "returnFields": [
    "document",
    "catalog"
  ]
}
```

This json query searches "ibm" in all documents than filters the documents by:
```
language="en" and (document.type="course" or document.type="article") and (document.cost>0 and document.cost<=1000)
```
```
      "document.cost": {
        "gt": 0,
        "lte": 1000
      }
```

**Parameter: search** *(optional)*

The string provided in the search param will be search along all documents and only the documents matching the search will be returned.

**Parameter: filter** *(optional)*

Should be an object containing 2 possible values: "or", "and". Both are optional.
The "or" and "and" field could be:
- object: conditions are given as key:value pairs
```
    "and": {
      "document.language": "en",
      "document.type": ["course", "article"]
    }
```
- array: conditions are given as objects containing key:value pairs
```
    "and": [
      {
        "document.tags": "cloud"
      },
      {
        "document.tags": "ibm"
      },
      {
        "document.status": ["Active", "Published"]
      }
    ]
```
This filter will translate to:
```
document.tags="cloud" and document.tags="ibm" and (document.status="Active" or document.status="Published")
```

If the value of the condition is an array then if at least one value from the array is found then the condition is true.

If the value of the condition is an object then the following operators can be used inside that object:
```
eq, ne, gt, lt, gte, lte, regex, regexi
```

Is also possible to use the "and" operator inside "or":
```
"filter": {
        "or": {
            "document.owner": "john.doe@email.com",
            "and": {
                "document.published": true,
                "document.langcode": "en"
            }
        }
    }
```
This filter will translate to:
```
document.owner="john.doe@email.com" or (document.published=true and document.langcode="en")
```

**Parameter: sort** *(optional)*

If sort is missing, the default sort is by relevance. Possible values for sort are: "asc" and "desc".
```
  "sort": {
    "title": "asc"
  }
```

**Parameter: limit** *(optional)*

Limits the number of returned results to the given interval.

**Parameter: fuzzy** *(optional)*

If fuzzy is true and there is no result found on the regular search, then a fuzzy search will be run and the fuzzy search results will be returned.
This is useful when there is a typo in the search term, and instead of returning an empty list it will return fuzzy match results.

If the returned results are from a fuzzy search, the field fuzzy: true will be added in the response object.


**Parameter: returnFilterValues** *(optional)*

If true then the list of filter values found in the response will be returned.


**Parameter: returnFiltersCount** *(optional)*

If true then the list of filter values found in the response will be returned along with the corresponding count.


**Parameter: returnFilterCounters** *(optional)*

If true then the list of filter values and the counters will be returned for updating the filters in the search page after each search.

Counters are not the exact count as in the filtersCount above, but what the user expects to see in the filters side panel on the search page.

You can check how the counters work on the bestbuy.com website: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tvs/4k-ultra-hd-tvs/pcmcat333800050003.c?id=pcmcat333800050003


**Parameter: returnFields** *(optional)*

If present, returnFields must be an array containing the list of fields to be returned in the response.


#### Search Suggestions

Search text in the metadata fields defined at search initialization. Returns the search suggestions based on the user input so far.


#### Filters Count

Returns the full list of all values for each filter defined in search initialization, along with the total count for each value.
