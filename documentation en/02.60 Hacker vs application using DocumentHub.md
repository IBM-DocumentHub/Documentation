## Hacker vs application using DocumentHub


### Hackers will try to access the content without a token

- access rules are defined in each catalog
- content can be either public or restricted to authorized users
- if the catalog has public access defined then the content can be accessed without a token
- if the catalog has restricted access to authorized users then the content will be be available for unauthorized users. Hacker will not be able to access the content without a valid token.


### Hackers will try to access the content with an altered token

- tokens are signed with the library secret
- they are verified on every request and they cannot be altered by hackers
- each application can verify the caasToken on their own backend using the library secret


### Hackers will try to find backdoors to the content restricted by the access control rules

- DocumentHub is used in production in many projects and it proved to be reliable and secure
- if an issue is discovered in one of the apps where DocumentHub is used, it is resolved quickly and all the other apps will benefit of that fix immediately
- DocumentHub is verified with multiple PEN tests from different providers


### Hackers will try to get into the server

- DocumentHub is running on a secure server with active firewall and secure user login


### Hackers will try random routes on the server

- users trying inexistent routes are temporarily banned
- there are no secret routes to open backdoors so their effort cannot be successful


### Hackers will try SQL injection

- the PEN tests ran periodically on DocumentHub include SQL injection scenarios


### Hackers will try script injection

- the PEN tests ran periodically on DocumentHub include script injection scenarios


### Hackers will try DDOS attacks

- DocumentHub is protected by an Akamai proxy with dedicated hardware for DDOS attacks
