## Subcatalogs

Subcatalogs are a logical subset of the documents from the physical catalog.

They are defined as json files in the root of the branch, with the naming convention: subcatalog Name.json

Each subcatalog has an id and can be used just like a physical catalog. You can load content from subcatalog, search subcatalog, just like any other physical catalog.

Example of subcatalog: 

subcatalog A.json
```
{
  "title": "Demo catalog - Subcatalog A",
  "owners": {},
  "creators": {},
  "editors": {},
  "viewers": {},
  "previewers": {},
  "copyright": {},
  "documents": [
    "a", 
    "b", 
    "c en", 
    "c fr"
  ],
  "info": {},
  "documentsInfo": {}
}
```

In this example, subcatalog A has a catalog id and can be used just like any other catalog.
Subcatalog A contains only 4 documents, no matter how many documents are present in that branch:
- document a with all its languages
- document b with all its languages
- document c with languages en and fr 


There is no change at the document level. The documents are the same. The subcatalog is a view which contains only a part of documents from that branch.
