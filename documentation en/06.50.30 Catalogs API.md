Catalogs API documentation is here: https://developer.ibm.com/edge/documenthub/api/#/Catalogs


#### How to identify if a catalog is physical or logical

If the catalog is physical, in the catalog response you have:

- subcatalogs fields, if the catalog has any subcatalogs

If the catalog is logical, in the catalog response you have:
- parentCatalogId field
