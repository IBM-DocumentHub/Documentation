## Web Components

Are a simple way to include features in your application with a slight effort.

### Article component

Article component shows a document in a web page in the form of an article - all contents shown in a long, single page. Optionally it can show the table of contents in the begining of the article.

### Document component

Document component shows a document in a web page, one module at a time. The table of contents is shown on the left side and one module content at a time, on the rest of the page. 


### Search Page component

Search page component renders a set of features to easly search through DocumentHub's content and display it ease.

#### How to use

1. Presumably you have the ```documenthub-components``` module installed (if not, see [here](https://link-to-install-steps) how to install)
2. Include ```<documenthub-searchpage catalogid="CATALOG_ID" token="auth-token" />```
    1. ```catalogid``` helps the component identify the catalog in order to fetch the data
    2. ```token``` is required for making authorized requests
