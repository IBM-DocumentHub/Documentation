## Web Components

DocumentHub Web Components can be used to easily embed content into web pages.

Components are build up using [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction)

### How to install

Install the documenthub-components package:

```
npm i documenthub-components
```


### How to use it

#### React

Import documenthub-components:

```
import { defineCustomElements } from 'documenthub-components/loader'
```

and then call:

```
defineCustomElements()
```



### Article component

Article component shows a document in a web page in the form of an article - all contents shown in a long, single page. Optionally it can show the table of contents in the begining of the article.

### Document component

Document component shows a document in a web page, one module at a time. The table of contents is shown on the left side and one module content at a time, on the rest of the page. 


### Search Page component

Search page component renders a set of features to easly search through DocumentHub's content and display it ease.

#### How to use

1. Presumably you have the ```documenthub-components-container``` module installed (if not, see [here](https://github.com/IBM-DocumentHub/Documentation/blob/master/documentation%20en/06.30%20Web%20Components.md#how-to-install) how to install)
2. Include ```<documenthub-searchpage catalogid="CATALOG_ID" token="auth-token" />```
    1. ```catalogid``` helps the component identify the catalog in order to fetch the data
    2. ```token``` is required for making authorized requests
    3. ```documenthref``` link to be used on redirect when the user clicks the card from the results 
    (I.E https://hostname.ibm.com/document/{documentid}/{language})
      - the value between the brackets ```{}``` , will be replaced with the document corresponding data.

Search Page component shows a full search page containing:
- search field in the top
  - user enters a search criteria and clicks submit to get results 
- filters on the left side
  - user checks a filter and coresponding results will be displayed
  - the filters amount and availability will be updated based on the current results
- sort criteria on the top-right
  - user selects an option from the dropdown and the corresponding order of results will be displayed 
- pagination and number of results per page in the bottom
  - user selects a page from the dropdown and the corresponding results will be displayed
  - user clicks next and the page will be incremented
  - user clicks previous and the page will be decremented 
- results on the content area
  - user will see the data displayed as cards
