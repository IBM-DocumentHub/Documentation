## Search in a catalog with document level access control

If a catalog has document level access control defined (access control fields in curly brackets), the search will return different results for each user, depending on the access control match for each document. 


For the example catalog below, the search will return different results for different users:
- for the user admin@ibm.com search will return all the documents because he is found in the owners field
- for the user manager@ibm.com search will return all the documents because he is found in the viewers field
- for the user z@us.ibm.com search will return all the documents because he matches the pattern ```*@us.ibm.com``` found in the viewers field
- for the user aaa@ibm.com search will return all the documents because he is part of acl Viewers.json found in the viewers field
- for the user x@ibm.com search will return only the documents he created and the documents in which he is found in the reviewers field from document.json
