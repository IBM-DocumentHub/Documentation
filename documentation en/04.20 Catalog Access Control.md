## Catalog Access Control


There are five access control fields:
- owners - can view and update catalog and documents
- creators - can create documents
- editors - can view catalog and documents and can create and update documents
- viewers - can view catalog and documents
- previewers - can view catalog and documents metadata. They are not allowed to view the documents content.


Access control at the catalog level can be defined, like this:

```
{
  ...
  "owners": [
    "library1": ["john@doe.com", "acl admins"]
  ],
  "creators": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ],
  "editors": [
    "library2": ["john@rambo.com", "*ibm.com", "{document.author}"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ]
  "previewers": []
}
```

In the example above:
- users john@doe.com and those listed in acl admins, from library1, are catalog owners
- all users can create documents
- users john@rambo.com, all users under ibm.com domain, and the user defined in document.author field, from library2, are document editors
- all users form library2 are viewers
- no one has preview access

The access fields are visible only for catalog owners.

If an access field is missing or empty then is considered that no one has that level of access.

An access field contains a set of libraries and for each library a list of users, which can have one of the following values:
- an user id - "john@doe.com"
- a pattern - "*ibm.com"
- an acl file - "acl admins"
- a field from the document - "{document.author}"
- "all" - which means all users from that library have access
