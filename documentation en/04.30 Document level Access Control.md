## Document level Access Control

Document level access control is obtained by using fields from the document.json in the catalog access control fields. The fields from the document.json have to be defined between curly brackets.

In the example catalog below, the access to documents is conditioned by the following rules:
- only users from library1 can access this catalog
- user admin@ibm.com has owner access to catalog
- all users from library1 can create documents in this catalog
- documents edit is restricted to: 
  - the user who created the document
  - the list of users defined in the field reviewers from document.json
  - manager@ibm.com
- all users from library1 can view documents from this catalog
- there are no previewers

```
catalog.json
{
   "version": 8,
   "title": "Demo catalog",
   "owners": {
      "library1": [
         "admin@ibm.com"
      ]
   },
   "creators": {
      "library1": [
         "all"
      ]
   },
   "editors": {
      "library1": [
         "{createdBy}",
         "{document.reviewers}",
         "manager@ibm.com"
      ]
   },
   "viewers": {
      "library1": [
         "all"
      ]
   },
   "previewers": {},
   ...
```
