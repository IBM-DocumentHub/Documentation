## Document level Access Control

Document level access control is obtained by using fields from the document.json in the catalog access control fields. The fields from the document.json have to be defined between curly brackets.


### Access control roles

There are five access roles:
- owners - can view and update catalog and documents
- creators - can create documents
- editors - can view catalog and documents and can create and update documents
- viewers - can view catalog and documents
- previewers - can view catalog and documents metadata


### Document level access rules

Access control at the document level can be defined like this:

```
{
  ...
  "creators": {
    "library1": ["all"]
  },
  "editors": {
    "library1": ["{createdBy}", "{document.authors}"]
  },
  "viewers": {
    "library2": ["all"]
  }
  ...
}
```

In the example above:
- all users can create documents
- documents can be updated only by the user who created each document or the users defined in the field authors from each document
- all users form library2 are viewers

#### Document access control field

The fields used for document access control, can contain a string or an array of strings:

```
{document.authors} -> "john@ibm.com"
{document.authors} -> ["john@ibm.com", "joe@ibm.com"]
```

An access field contains one or more users, which can have one of the following values:
- an user id - e.g. "john@doe.com"
- a pattern - e.g. "*ibm.com"
- an acl file - e.g. "acl admins"


### Combined catalog and document level access rules

In the example catalog below, the access to documents is conditioned by the following rules:
- only users from library1 can access this catalog
- user admin@ibm.com has owner access to catalog
- all users from library1 can create documents in this catalog
- documents edit is restricted to: 
  - the user who created the document
  - the list of users defined in the field reviewers from document.json
  - manager@ibm.com
- all users from library1 can view documents from this catalog
- there are no previewers

```
catalog.json
{
   "version": 8,
   "title": "Demo catalog",
   "owners": {
      "library1": [
         "admin@ibm.com"
      ]
   },
   "creators": {
      "library1": [
         "all"
      ]
   },
   "editors": {
      "library1": [
         "{createdBy}",
         "{document.reviewers}",
         "manager@ibm.com"
      ]
   },
   "viewers": {
      "library1": [
         "all"
      ]
   },
   "previewers": {},
   ...
```


### Use Case

For this use case we have the following access control rules:

Create documents: 
- all users authorized in library1 can create documents

View/Edit documents:
  - the user who created the document
  - the sales leader correponding to the document creator's department
  - the brand leader correponding to the document creator's department
  - the financial reviewer correponding to the document creator's geography
  - the managers of the document creator
  - the geo focal correponding to the document creator's geography
  - a list of admins

All the above rules are defined in the following catalog.json. Based on the catalog.json definition, **DocumentHub will handle all the access control rules**. No other access control code is needed in the application.

Each user will be able to see only the documents visible to him. The search will return only the documents visible to the current user. The documents CRUD operations will be restricted to the rules defined in the catalog.json.

catalog.json
```
{
   "title": "I-STA Data catalog",
   "version": 8,
   "owners": {
      "library1": [
         "florin.dumitrescu@ro.ibm.com"
      ]
   },
   "creators": {
      "library1": [
         "all"
      ]
   },
   "editors": {
      "library1": [
         "{createdBy}",
         "{document.roles.salesLead}",
         "{document.roles.brandLead}",
         "{document.roles.financialReviewer}",
         "{document.roles.managers}",
         "{document.roles.geoFocal}",
         "acl Admins"
      ]
   },
   "viewers": {},
   "previewers": {},
   ...
```
