## Configure access control rules for documents

### Access control roles

There are five access roles:
- owners - can view and update catalog and documents
- creators - can create documents
- editors - can view catalog and documents and can create and update documents
- viewers - can view catalog and documents
- previewers - can view catalog and documents metadata


### Document level access rules

Access control at the document level can be defined like this:

```
{
  ...
  "creators": [
    "library1": ["all"]
  ],
  "editors": [
    "library1": ["{createdBy}", "{document.authors}"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ]
  ...
}
```

In the example above:
- all users can create documents
- documents can be updated only by the user who created each document or the users defined in the field authors from each document
- all users form library2 are viewers
