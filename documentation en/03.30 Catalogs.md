## Private files

## Access control

Access control at the catalog level can be defined like this:

```
{
  ...
  "owners": [
    "library1": ["john@doe.com"]
  ],
  "editors": [
    "library2": ["john@doe.com", "john@rambo.com"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ]
  "previewers": []
}
```

The access fields are visible only for catalog owners.
If an access field is missing or empty then is considered that no one has that level of access.
