### Catalog access control

There are four access fields:
- owners - can view and update catalog and documents
- editors - can view catalog and documents and can create and update documents
- viewers - can view catalog and documents
- previewers - can view catalog and documents metadata

Access control at the catalog level can be defined, like this:

```
{
  ...
  "owners": [
    "library1": ["john@doe.com", "acl admins"]
  ],
  "editors": [
    "library2": ["john@doe.com", "john@rambo.com", "*ibm.com"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ]
  "previewers": []
}
```

In the example above:
- users john@doe.com and those listed in acl admins, from library1, are catalog owners
- users john@doe.com, john@rambo.com and all users under ibm.com domain, from library2, are editors
- all users form library2 are viewers
- no one has preview access

The access fields are visible only for catalog owners.

If an access field is missing or empty then is considered that no one has that level of access.

An access field contains a set of libraries and for each library a list of users, which can have one of the following values:
- an user id - "john@doe.com"
- a pattern - "*ibm.com"
- an acl file - "acl admins"
- "all" - which means all users from that library have access

Access to documents can be limited by providing the user in a document field, like this:

```
{
  ...
  "editors": [
    "library1": ["{author}"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library1": ["all"]
  ]
}
```

In the example above:
- all users from library1 can create documents but only document.author can update the document
- all users from library1 can view catalog and documents
