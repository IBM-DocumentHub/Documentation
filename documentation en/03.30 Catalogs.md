### Catalog access control

Access control at the catalog level can be defined, like this:

```
{
  ...
  "owners": [
    "library1": ["john@doe.com"]
  ],
  "editors": [
    "library2": ["john@doe.com", "john@rambo.com"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["all"]
  ]
  "previewers": []
}
```

The access fields are visible only for catalog owners.
If an access field is missing or empty then is considered that no one has that level of access.

**owners** - can view and update catalog and documents
**editors** - can view catalog and documents and can create and update documents
**viewers** - can view catalog and documents
**previewers** - can view catalog and documents metadata


Access to documents can be limited to document authors, like this:

```
{
  ...
  "editors": [
    "library1": ["{document.author}"]
  ],
  "viewers": [
    "library2": ["{document.author}"]
  ]
}
```
