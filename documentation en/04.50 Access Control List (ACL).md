## Access Control List (ACL)

### How to define ACL files

Users can be grouped in ACL files. The format of these files is acl Name.json and they are located in the root of the catalog (branch).

```
acl Group A.json
acl Managers.json
acl admins.json
```

The acl file must contain an array of strings.

```
[
  "john@ibm.com",
  "joe@ibm.com",
  "admin"
]
```

The value can be given in multiple forms:
- simple: "john@ibm.com"
- email: "<john@ibm.com>"
- name and email: "John john@ibm.com" or "John <john@ibm.com>"
- role and user: "Manager john@ibm.com" or "Manager Editor john@ibm.com"

```
acl editors.json
[
  "john@ibm.com",
  "Manager joe@ibm.com",
  "Admin admin",
  "bill@ibm.com"
]
```

### How to use ACL files

In the catalog's access control fields:

```
catalog.json
  ...
  "editors": {
    "lib1": ["acl editors"]
  }
  ...
```


In the document's access control fields:

```
catalog.json
  ...
  "editors": {
    "lib1": ["{document.editors}"]
  }
  ...

document.json
  ...
  "editors": ["acl editors"]
```
