## Access Control List (ACL)

### How to define ACL files

Users can be grouped in ACL files. The naming convention for these files is ```acl Name.json```, and they are located in the root of the catalog (branch):

```
acl Group A.json
acl Managers.json
acl admins.json
```

The acl file must contain an array of strings:

```
[
  "john@ibm.com",
  "joe@ibm.com",
  "admin"
]
```

The value can be given in multiple forms:
- simple userId: ```john@ibm.com```
- between angle brackets: ```<john@ibm.com>```
- name and userId: ```John john@ibm.com``` or ```John <john@ibm.com>```
- role and userId: ```Manager john@ibm.com``` or ```Manager Editor john@ibm.com```

```
acl editors.json
[
  "john@ibm.com",
  "Manager joe@ibm.com",
  "Admin admin",
  "bill@ibm.com"
]
```

### How to use ACL files

In the catalog's access control fields:

```
catalog.json
  ...
  "editors": {
    "lib1": ["acl editors"]
  }
  ...
```


In the document's access control fields:

```
catalog.json
  ...
  "editors": {
    "lib1": ["{document.editors}"]
  }
  ...

document.json
  ...
  "editors": ["acl editors"]
```

### How to get all groups and roles for the authorized user

The list of ACL files containing the authorized user can be obtained along with roles in each ACL.

From Javascript package:
```
await documenthub8.getUserACL()
```

From API:
```
GET /edge/documenthub/v8/catalogs/{catalogId}/useracl
```


Example:

```
acl admins.json
[
  "admin"
]

acl editors.json
[
  "john@ibm.com",
  "Manager joe@ibm.com",
  "Admin admin",
  "bill@ibm.com"
]

acl reviewers.json
[
  "joe@ibm.com",
  "Admin admin"
]

acl users.json
[
  "IBMer *@ibm.com",
  "IBMer *@*.ibm.com",
  "IBM US *@us.ibm.com"
]
```

If the authorized user is ```joe@us.ibm.com```, the ```await documenthub8.getUserACL()``` function will return:

```
{
  "users": ["IBMer", "IBM US"]
}
```

The ```getUserACL()``` function will return all the ACL files where the authorized user is found, along with the corresponding name/role in that ACL, if that is specified.


### Negative patterns

If you want to accept all emails except gmail.com and yahoo.com, you can define it with negative patterns:

```
acl users.json
[
  "!*@gmail.com",
  "!*@yahoo.com"
]
```
