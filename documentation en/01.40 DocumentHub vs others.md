## WYSIWYG editors (What You See Is What You Get)

DocumentHub keeps the content in GitHub in a human readable format. You can choose any content format you want, including HTML or Markdown.

For editing the content you can use GitHub UI or any other external editor.

One of the recommended editors is Visual Studio Code which has many free extensions available, including WYSIWYG editors. Here are some of them:
