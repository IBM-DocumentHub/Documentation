## Why DocumentHub

Applications have almost the same components, but instead of reusing the code, most of the teams rewrite the same components every time, spending a lot of time on development and testing, taking risks and technical challenges.

**DocumentHub saves hundreds of hours of frontend and backend development and solves many risks and technical challenges.**

- DocumentHub is a CMS tuned for application development, to help develop better applications in a shorter time and at lower costs
- it comes with the most common features and components needed in application development to help implement the functionalities quicker
- some features are similar in multiple applications, but instead of reusing the code, often developers rewrite the same code, over and over again
- these similar features found in applications are available as features and components in DocumentHub, so you can reuse them instead of writing that code once again
- DocumentHub saves hundreds of hours of frontend and backend development

#### Reduced risks and technical challenges

- in any development process there are risks and technical challenges
- many of these risks and challenges can be reduced by using DocumentHub platform and components
- all DocumentHub components and used in production in many projects and they proved to be reliable and secure

#### Reduced costs with development and hardware

- reduce costs with development by using existing DocumentHub features and components and saving hundreds of hours of development and test
- reduce hardware costs by using DocumentHub “as a service”

#### Compatible with any modern web and mobile framework

- DocumentHub is compatible with almost any modern web and mobile framework

#### Content stored in GitHub

- GitHub is the best content versioning system
- benefit of all GitHub features
- content is stored in a human readable format
- use GitHub as an Admin module, already built it
- use any external editor and sync changes with GitHub
- change log, history, differences, revert changes
- make changes in GitHub and they will be immediately available in application
- make changes in application and they will be immediately updated in GitHub
- disaster recovery

#### Search and Filter

- the fastest search engine, 5x faster than IBM Enterprise Search. See a comparison here: [https://developer.ibm.com/edge/documenthub/benchmark/enterprise-search-comparison.html](https://developer.ibm.com/edge/documenthub/benchmark/enterprise-search-comparison.html)
- accurate search for precise results and fuzzy search for finding matches even for a typo
- complex filtering rules
- search, filter, order and pagination in a single request
- returns filters count for easily showing the filter counters in the page
- automatic filtering based on each user access

#### Security

- basic and bearer authorizations
- access control lists
- access control rules
- access control at library, catalog and document levels
- PEN test verified
- used in production in many projects and proved to be reliable and secure

#### IBMid/w3id SSO

- integration with IBMid and w3id SSO
- SSO implementation in only 2 minutes
- automatic token and cookie management
- stays updated with latest SSO changes without requiring redeploy when IBM SSO is updated

#### Cloud Object Storage

- all attachments are automatically uploaded to IBM Cloud Object Storage

#### Akamai CDN

- all files from Cloud Object Storage are automatically mapped to an Akamai CDN
- caching content in multiple locations over the globe
- automatic image and video optimization for mobile and other low connection devices

#### Web Components

- embed content in web pages using the DocumentHub Web Components
- they can be used for speeding up the development process
- article web component shows a document in a web page in the form of an article
- document web component shows a document in a web page in a browsable view, with a table of contents on the left
- course web component show a document in a web page in a course view, with a table of contents on the left and the completion status of each module
- quiz web component shows a quiz in a web page and communicates the quiz results to a server
- search page web component show a complete search page with search bar, filters, sort, pagination and clickable results in a gird or list view

#### Templates

- templates are application skeletons like React + Carbon + DocumentHub + IBM SSO or Node + DocumentHub + IBM SSO
- they can be used for speeding up the development process

#### Multi-Language

- all documents can have multiple languages

#### API

- very fast API endpoints available

#### Email

- a SendGrid account is available for sending emails from any IBM email address to any internal or external email addresses


### How to speed up the development for the MVP

- **use the DocumentHub Web Templates**: if there is a web template with the technologies you want, it will save time to reuse it instead of writing a new one from scratch. If there is no web template yet with the set of technologies you want, please add it to the Web Templates repository (after you integrate the DocumentHub and the SSO), to help others save time when they start new projects.
- **use the DocumentHub SSO component**: adding IBMid SSO or w3ID SSO takes one hour with DocumentHub SSO component or one week if you write everything from scratch.
- **use GitHub UI instead of building admin pages**: at least for the MVP, avoid building custom admin pages. Use instead a repository to keep all your config files.
- **use the DocumentHub Cloud Object Storage and Akamai CDN**: just add images or any other public content in the attachments folders and they will be automatically uploaded to Cloud Object Storage and made available on Akamai CDN.
- **use the DocumentHub Javascript package**: if you are building an application based on Javascript, it's faster to use the DocumentHub Javascript package: documenthub npm package for version 7 and documenthub8 npm package for version 8
- **use the DocumentHub Search Page component**: most applications have a search page. You can add this functionality in one day by using the Search Page component, instead of spending a couple of weeks with development and testing.
- **use the DocumentHub ACL instead of writing access control code**: use the access control rules and the ACL files to quickly set up the minimal access control requirements for the MVP. Developing and testing all the security scenarios can consume a lot of time. DocumentHub access control is already tested and proved to be stable and secure.
- **use the DocumentHub Web Components**: Article, Document, Form, Quiz, Course, Search Page. Save development and testing time by reusing the existing web components. Do you find it useful to build other new components? Write your suggestions on the #documenthub Slack channel.
- **use the DocumentHub Search and Filter**: DocumentHub has the fastest search engine, 5x faster than IBM Enterprise Search. Search is also integrated with the access control rules, so every user will receive only what he is allowed to see.
