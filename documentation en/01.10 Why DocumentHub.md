## Why DocumentHub

DocumentHub is a lightweight, modern CMS, created with the latest architecture and technologies and is compatible with the latest frameworks. 

Applications have almost the same components, but instead of reusing the code, most of the teams rewrite the same components every time, spending a lot of time on development and testing, taking risks and technical challenges.

DocumentHub saves hundreds of hours of frontend and backend development, without risks and technical challenges.
