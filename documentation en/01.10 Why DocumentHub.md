## Why DocumentHub

Applications have almost the same components, but instead of reusing the code, most of the teams rewrite the same components every time, spending a lot of time on development and testing, taking risks and technical challenges.

**DocumentHub saves hundreds of hours of frontend and backend development and solves many risks and technical challenges.**
